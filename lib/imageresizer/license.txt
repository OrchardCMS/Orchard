The core and 18 plugins are free and open-source, under a modified MIT license called the Freedom license. 
See http://imageresizing.net/licenses/freedom

The following DLLs are under the Freedom license:

* ImageResizer.dll
* ImageResizer.Mvc.dll 
* ImageResizer.Plugins.Logging.dll 


Development of this project is funded by people purchasing Pro and Enterprise licenses
to the 4 paid plugin bundles. Both Pro and Enterprise licenses are as MIT-like as possible, 
allowing redistribution, modification, and sub-licensing.

The free trial license permits use of the paid plugins for development and testing purposes, but not for production use.

Once you begin using them on a production server, you will need a Pro or Enterprise-wide license.
