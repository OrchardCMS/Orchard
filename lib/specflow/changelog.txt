1.4.0 - 2010/10/07

Breaking changes:
+ The generator has been improved to provide source code language. Because of this, SpecFlow test generated 
  with this version will be incompatible with older runtimes.

New features:
+ Scoped Step Definitions: you can scope step definitions (bindings) to tags, features and scenarios. Scope filter 
  can be applied to a class or a method with the [StepScope] attribute.
  See examples in Tests/FeatureTests/ScopedSteps/ScopedSteps.feature and Tests/FeatureTests/ScopedSteps/ScopedStepsBindings.cs
  (Thanks to Jose Simas for the contribution.)
+ Adding binding-culture to App.config. If set, this culture is used during execution of steps.
+ VB-Step-Definition Skeleton Provider: For VB-projects, the suggested step skeletons are generated in VB.
+ Merging strongly typed context accessors from Darren Cauthon's SpecFlowAssist
+ Merging table/row extension methods from Darren Cauthon's SpecFlowAssist 
  Add a using statement for the namespace TechTalk.SpecFlow.Assist to use the extension methods.
  See also Darren's youtube tutorial: http://bit.ly/aY4VOd
+ Diagnostic tracing: VS2010 integration can display trace messages to the Output window
  if tracing is enabled. Tracing can be enabled by setting the environment variable SPECFLOW_TRACE
  to either "all" or to the comma separated list of individual SpecFlow traing categories (currently
  only the category "EditorParser" is supported).

Fixed issues:
+ Better error reporting for wrong Gherkin files (multiple errors displayed, detect duplicate scenario names)
+ Visual Studio 2010 editor slows down after editing a feature file for a longer time (Issue 9)

1.3.5.2 - 2010/08/11

Fixed issues:
+ Sorry, we're ironing out our deploy strategy with the new Mono/MonoDevelop integration.  We didn't 
  change the version in the MonoDevelop Add-In XML file.

1.3.5.1 - 2010/08/11

New features:
+ Support for hosting add-in on http://addins.monodevelop.com

1.3.5 - 2010/08/11

New features:
+ Support for Mono (v2.6.7) & MonoDevelop (v2.4) by Dale Ragan

Fixed issues:
+ Generating code randomly for the wrong testing engine
+ Test class generation problem for Russian feature files
+ Fix tag support for Silverlight

1.3.4 - 2010/07/28

Fixed issues:
+ Installation fails if Visual Studio 2010 is not installed

1.3.3 - 2010/07/19

New features:
+ Support for MsTest report generation
  usage: specflow mstestexecutionreport projectFile [/testResult:value] [/xsltFile:value] [/out:value]
    projectFile             Visual Studio Project File containing specs
    [/testResult:value]     Test Result file generated by MsTest. Defaults to TestResult.trx
    [/out:value]            Generated Output File. Defaults to TestResult.html
    [/xsltFile:value]       Xslt file to use, defaults to built-in stylesheet if not provided
+ Visual Studio 2010 editor support: 
    - syntax coloring with configurable colors ("Gherkin ...")
    - outlining for scenarios
  Uninstall the beta integration (TechTalk.SpecFlow.VsIntegration.GherkinFile.vsix) before installing 
  SpecFlow 1.3.3.

Fixed issues:
+ MbUnit execution fails for pending steps (Assert method not found: Inconclusive)

1.3.2 - 2010/06/29

New features:
+ Support for MsTest for .NET 4.0 categories. Configure the test provider name to 
  "MsTest.2010" in order to use the [TestCategory] attribute.
+ Silverlight support (beta), see http://wiki.github.com/techtalk/SpecFlow/silverlight-support  

Fixed issues:
+ Report generation fails if no custom XSLT is provided


1.3.1 - 2010/06/21

New features:
+ Using standard Gherkin parser (http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/gherkin) v2.0.1
+ Custom XSLT can be specified for generating reports. 
  See examples in Tests/ReportingTests/CustomXsltTemplate.feature
+ The test error can be accessed through ScenarioContext.Current.TestError 
  (e.g. in an AfterScenario event).
+ [StepTransformation] attribute has been renamed to [StepArgumentTransformation]
  because this name describe the intention better. Using the old attribute will 
  generate a warning.
+ Support for MbUnit

Fixed issues:
+ NullReference exception when using BeforeTestRun event (Issue 41)

1.3.0 - 2010/05/05

New features:
+ Using standard Gherkin parser (http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/gherkin) v1.0.24
+ Context injection in step definitions. Step definitions can get a context injected with 
  constructor injection. (Issue 30)
  See examples in Tests/FeatureTests/ContextInjection
+ Using steps in other assemblies. This enables writing steps in VB. (Issue 19)
  See examples in Tests/FeatureTests/ExternalSteps 
+ Steps can be invoked from other steps using step text. See examples in 
  Tests/FeatureTests/CallingStepsFromStepDefinitions
+ Custom step parameter converters can be defined as a binding. 
  See examples in Tests/FeatureTests/StepArgumentTransfomation
+ SpecFlow feature files can be added also to VB.NET projects
+ Support for xUnit
+ Single installer for Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 (Issue 6, 10, 11)
+ Place GeneratedCodeAttribute and 'Designer generated code' region on generated code to 
  avoid having this code parsed by code analysis. (Issue 33)
+ Configuration option to disable all output. (Issue 29)
  Use the following config to disable output:
  <trace listener="TechTalk.SpecFlow.Tracing.NullListener, TechTalk.SpecFlow" />

Fixed issues:
+ SpecFlow Reporting doesn't work with Firefox (Issue 31)
+ Binding methods are executed using the culture of the feature file.
+ Several parsing issues are solved now (Issue 1, 8, 9, 37)

1.2.0 - 2009/11/25

New features:
+ Generate #line pragmas to the output file (Issue 26)
+ Allow transformation of feature files from command-line and MsBuild (Issue 3)
+ Merge all command-line tool (generation, reports) to a single executable: specflow.exe
+ Support for Dutch and Swedish language
+ Support enumerations in step binding arguments (Issue 28)

Fixed issues:
+ MsTest does not refresh tests automatically (Issue 25)
+ Fixes in report localization
+ Non-string parameters for bindings are not converted using the feature language (Issue 26)

1.1.0 - 2009/11/11

New features:
+ Support for MsTest (Issue 4)
+ Finalize configuration (Issue 13)
+ Support German, French and Hungarian languages (Issue 5)
+ Add strong-name for specflow assemblies (Issue 2)

  test method names (Issue 22)

+ Runtime: support multiple step attributes on a single binding method

Fixed issues:
+ VS: Error message is displayed when you add a SpecFlow project item to your project.
