MySQL FOSS License Exception
We want free and open source software applications under 
certain licenses to be able to use the GPL-licensed MySQL 
Connector/NET (specified GPL-licensed MySQL client libraries)
despite the fact that not all such FOSS licenses are 
compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License.
Therefore there are special exceptions to the terms and
conditions of the GPLv2 as applied to these client libraries, 
which are identified and described in more detail in the 
FOSS License Exception at
<http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception.html>

license versions is made available with the language indicating 
that GPLv2 or any later version may be used, or where a choice 
of which version of the GPL is applied is otherwise unspecified.
