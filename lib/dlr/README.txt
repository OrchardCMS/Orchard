== About

IronRuby is a Open Source implementation of the Ruby programming language
(http://www.ruby-lang.org) for .NET, heavily relying on the 
Dynamic Language Runtime (http://dlr.codeplex.com).

The project's #1 goal is to be a true Ruby implementation, meaning it runs
existing Ruby code. See
http://ironruby.net/Documentation/Real_Ruby_Applications for information about
using the Ruby standard library and 3rd party libraries in IronRuby.

IronRuby has tightly integration with .NET, so any .NET types can be used from
IronRuby, and the IronRuby runtime can be embedded into any .NET application.
See http://ironruby.net/documentation/.net for more information.

== Running

Will run rubyfile.rb with the IronRuby compiler.
