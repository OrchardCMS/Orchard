## About The Orchard Project

#### Please visit our website at https://orchardproject.net for the most current information about this project.

Orchard is a free, open source, community-focused **Content Management System** built on the ASP.NET MVC platform.

Orchard is built on a modern architecture that puts extensibility up-front, as its number one concern. All components in Orchard can be replaced or extended. Content is built from easily composable building blocks. Modules extend the system in a very decoupled fashion, where a commenting module for example can as easily apply to pages, blog posts, photos or products. A rich UI composition system completes the picture and ensures that you can get the exact presentation that you need for your content.

Orchard is delivered under the [.NET Foundation](https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/projects?searchquery=Orchard&type=project). It is licensed under a [New BSD license](https://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php), which is approved by the OSI.

Our mission is to empower our users and foster a dedicated and diverse community that builds the CMS that we all want to use.

## Project Status

## The Future Of Orchard CMS: Orchard Core

As the underlying frameworks (.NET, ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC) are constantly evolving, Orchard of course keeps track of the changes and improvements of these: Orchard Core is the next generation of Orchard releases that is based on [ASP.NET Core](https://www.asp.net/core). Just like the current Orchard project, it's fully [open-source and is publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore). Orchard Core (as a framework) is being built from scratch: it's still in development and does not share any of its code base (at least directly) with the current versions (1.x) of Orchard.
