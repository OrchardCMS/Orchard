## About The Orchard Project

#### Please visit our website at http://orchardproject.net for the most current information about this project.

Orchard is a free, open source, community-focused **Content Management System** built on the ASP.NET MVC platform.

Orchard is built on a modern architecture that puts extensibility up-front, as its number one concern. All components in Orchard can be replaced or extended. Content is built from easily composable building blocks. Modules extend the system in a very decoupled fashion, where a commenting module for example can as easily apply to pages, blog posts, photos or products. A rich UI composition system completes the picture and ensures that you can get the exact presentation that you need for your content.

Orchard is delivered under the [.NET Foundation](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/orchard). It is licensed under a [New BSD license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php), which is approved by the OSI.

Our mission is to empower our users and foster a dedicated and diverse community that builds the CMS that we all want to use.
