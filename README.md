## About The Orchard Project

#### Please visit our website at http://orchardproject.net for the most current information about this project.

Orchard is a free, open source, community-focused **Content Management System** built on the ASP.NET MVC platform.

Orchard is built on a modern architecture that puts extensibility up-front, as its number one concern. All components in Orchard can be replaced or extended. Content is built from easily composable building blocks. Modules extend the system in a very decoupled fashion, where a commenting module for example can as easily apply to pages, blog posts, photos or products. A rich UI composition system completes the picture and ensures that you can get the exact presentation that you need for your content.

Orchard is delivered under the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/orchard-cms). It is licensed under a [New BSD license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php), which is approved by the OSI.

Our mission is to empower our users and foster a dedicated and diverse community that builds the CMS that we all want to use.

## Project Status

Orchard is currently in version **[1.10.2](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard/releases/tag/1.10.2)**: It contains bugfixes and the more impactful changes and new features added in the latest major version (*1.10*).

We invite participation by the developer community in shaping the project’s direction, so that we can publicly validate our designs and development approach. 
All our releases are available on our [Releases](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard/releases) page, and it's easy to [Install Orchard using the Web Platform Installer](http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Installing-Orchard) as well. We encourage interested developers to check out the source code on the Orchard GitHub site and get involved with the project.

## The Future Of Orchard CMS: Orchard 2

As the underlying frameworks (.NET, ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC) are constantly evolving, Orchard of course keeps track of the changes and improvements of these: Orchard 2 is the next generation of Orchard releases that is based on [ASP.NET Core](http://www.asp.net/core). Just like the current Orchard project, it's fully [open-source and is publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard2). Orchard 2 (as a framework) is being built from scratch: it's still in development and does not share any of its code base (at least directly) with the current versions of Orchard.
