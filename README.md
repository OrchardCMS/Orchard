## About The Orchard Project

#### Please visit our website at http://orchardproject.net for the most current information about this project.

Orchard is a free, open source, community-focused project aimed at delivering applications and reusable components 
on the ASP.NET platform. It will create shared components for building ASP.NET applications and extensions, and
specific applications that leverage these components to meet the needs of end-users, scripters, and developers. 
Additionally, we seek to create partnerships with existing application authors to help them achieve their goals. 
Orchard is delivered under the [.NET Foundation](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/). It is licensed under a 
[New BSD license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php), which is approved by the OSI. The intended 
output of the Orchard project is three-fold:

* Individual .NET-based applications that appeal to end-users, scripters, and developers 
* A set of re-usable components that makes it easy to build such applications 
* A vibrant community to help define these applications and extensions
In the near term, the Orchard project is focused on delivering a .NET-based CMS application that will allow users 
to rapidly create content-driven Websites, and an extensibility framework that will allow developers and customizers to provide additional functionality through modules and themes.  You can learn more about the project on the [Orchard Project Website](http://www.orchardproject.net).

## Project Status
